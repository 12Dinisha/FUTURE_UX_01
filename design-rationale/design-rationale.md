# Design Rationale – UI/UX Design Task 1

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to redesign a local service business website with a strong focus on lead generation, conversion optimization, and user trust. The website was designed to reflect real-world client requirements, similar to how professional UI/UX designers work in agencies and startups.

- A single primary CTA color to reduce decision fatigue
- Repeated CTAs across pages to guide users
- Minimal lead capture form to reduce friction
- Clear visual hierarchy using spacing and typography
- Mobile-responsive layout for accessibility

- Low opacity and consistent illustration style
- Never placed over CTAs or form elements

This ensures the mascot enhances trust without distracting from conversion goals.
